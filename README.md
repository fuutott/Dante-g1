# Fahrplan

Fahrplan is a "life assistant" that is made for the Even Realities G1 smartglasses. It is an opinionated half reverse engineered addition go the G1. It focusses less on (or not on generative) AI and more on a day to day life assistant for neurodiverse people like myself.

The name "Fahrplan" comes from the german word for "bus/train/conference schedule". It takes the concept of a "next stops" screen you see on public transport to plan for daily tasks and schedule. Thus the idea for this name.

While it is meant to offer an "OS" for the Even Realities G1 and will copy some of the original functionality like notifications it is not designed to be a full smartglasses OS.

## Features

* Notification mirroring (app whitelist still needs to be build in official app, fixed soon)
* Update of time and weather 
* [Tr√§welling](https://traewelling.de/) integration for real time train info
* Daily: a daily "fahrplan" presented in G1 dashboard
* Stops: important one off-timers presenting an immediate text message for an important timed action (eg. leave for train)
* HomeAssistant: send commands by holding the left button (Even AI). Transcribed locally with Wisper
* Checklists: open and close lists on your dashboard by holding the right button (QuickNote) saying "checklist <name>" or "close checklist <name>"
* Debug screen: with extra fun like bad apple! (unzip assets/badapple.zip first before compiling for this)

## Get it!

- Latest build of the main branch: [Android APK](https://nightly.link/meyskens/fahrplan/workflows/build_apk/main/app-release.apk.zip)

## Why the G1 specifically?

Simple: they are the only glasses with display that fit my face and are able to ship my prescription. That's it.

## Supported OSes?

- Android (primary development)
- iOS (probably works in simple tasks, notifications and permissions will need work!)
- Linux will not work: experiments have been done with Bluez but BLE notifications are buggy, sorry 

## Thanks
Thanks to @emingenc and @NyasakiAT for their work in building the G1 BLE libraries, also thanks a lot to benny04409 for helping with reverse engineering the firmware.

## Copy me!

Sadly time constraints permit me from making some of my code into proper maintained Dart libraries. Please copy as much code as you want into your applications! Expanding the G1 open source ecosystem is better for everyone!
